# clj-video
A Clojure project for video encoding/decoding and manipulation

## Goals

### Declarative driven

### Stream compatible

### Simple affordances for native backing implementations

### Discoverable

  - Backing implementations
  - Capabilities

### Consolidation

  Some providers (like ffmpeg) support simple workflows. Although this library doesn't
support anything other than individual operations with a stereotyped execution chain,
part (or all) of that chain could be 'compressed' down into a single provider execution 
step under the right circumstances.
